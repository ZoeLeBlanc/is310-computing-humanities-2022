Working in pairs or individually, figure out how to use the data types, structures, and methods we discussed to solve these prompts. Save your work in a script, titled `lastname_week2.py` and upload it to Github before class on Thursday. 

1. Create a Github repository for your work. I would recommend naming it `IS310_assignments` or something similar. It will be where you will upload your work for the rest of the semester.
2. Create a data structure to store the table of top DH tools with their year and popularity count (Data from ["DH Tools Used in Research"](https://weltliteratur.net/dh-tools-used-in-research/)). Update the data structure to keep a count for overall (that is culminative) popularity of each tool over the five years. Print out the 2015, 2019, and overall values for each tool.

Data:

| Tool        | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Python      | 9    | 22   | 27   | 32   | 35   |
| JavaScript  | 8    | 18   | 12   | 6    | 15   |
| Twitter     | 10   | 18   | 26   | 16   | 12   |
| GitHub      | 2    | 6    | 17   | 5    | 10   |
| Gephi       | 11   | 16   | 14   | 10   | 9    |
| GeoNames    | 2    | 4    | 3    | 1    | 8    |
| Transkribus | 0    | 1    | 2    | 1    | 8    |
| Excel       | 5    | 9    | 3    | 6    | 7    |
| MySQL       | 0    | 6    | 9    | 5    | 7    |
