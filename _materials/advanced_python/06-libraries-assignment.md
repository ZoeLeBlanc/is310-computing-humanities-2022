1. Choose one of the packages we'll be looking at later in the class:
   - Pandas [https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
   - Altair
   - Spacy
   - Scikit-Learn
   - Networkx
OR select one you might use in your final project

2. Install it into your virtual environment [following instructions](virtual_environment.md)
3. Read through some of the documentation. See if you can find one Class and its built-in methods. Post a short description of the package (what is it used for?) and a method you're interested in testing out onto our discord channel `#coding-assignments`.
