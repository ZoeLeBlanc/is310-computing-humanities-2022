| Faadil Ahmed          | 04/07/2022 | Charisma is at the heart of Piper's distinction between close reading and computational modeling in this science of generalization. Because the procedures of close reading are often hidden from view, readers must trust the critic's authority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | This part is interesting because it requires the audience to listen to the author's ethos argument                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://hyp.is/4_bOiLYkEeyjuPdx9gfLIQ">https://hyp.is/4_bOiLYkEeyjuPdx9gfLIQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/4_bOiLYkEeyjuPdx9gfLIQ">https://hyp.is/4_bOiLYkEeyjuPdx9gfLIQ</a> |
| Faadil Ahmed          | 03/22/2022 | If I can come up with two perfectly plausible historical scenarios to explain opposing, hypothetical trends, then we clearly don’t have a settled answer to the question already, and it was entirely worth my time to try and run that humanistic experiment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I found this very interesting because it shows us how data does not always provide clear answers, and it is sometimes our decision to interpret the data and rationalize our own explanations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <a href="https://hyp.is/2OBOzKnyEeynTbc664Qr8A">https://hyp.is/2OBOzKnyEeynTbc664Qr8A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/2OBOzKnyEeynTbc664Qr8A">https://hyp.is/2OBOzKnyEeynTbc664Qr8A</a> |
| Faadil Ahmed          | 03/22/2022 | Before I made the visualization, I couldn’t predict the trend. I would have said something like “vaguely downwards.” I certainly could not have predicted the scale. When I have given this talk to various audiences, no one has been able to predict what the actual visualization should look like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This quote stuck out to me because it shows us the value and resourcefulness of data visualizations, by simply just looking at the visualizations, it can completelpely changes how me may perceive a certain type of data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/MFNPLKnwEeycJp_KiOwtBA">https://hyp.is/MFNPLKnwEeycJp_KiOwtBA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/MFNPLKnwEeycJp_KiOwtBA">https://hyp.is/MFNPLKnwEeycJp_KiOwtBA</a> |

However, I can understand it after readng the example. The human language emphasize to be concise and reader-friendly. However, computer can not read when it gets complicated. It will make data manipulation more difficult and raise many errors.

However, the idea of hackathon and the community around it interests me more. This foments the idea of localization of the database and enriches the DPLA content. From plain data to vivid visualization, I found the idea of hackathon as a contemporary sense of data infrastructure, connected with crowdsourcing, made it a great resource for both content creators and the audiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/l-fp_JmKEey53zvA1rlS_A">https://hyp.is/l-fp_JmKEey53zvA1rlS_A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/l-fp_JmKEey53zvA1rlS_A">https://hyp.is/l-fp_JmKEey53zvA1rlS_A</a> |

Also, there are trade-offs to datafy everything -- we are not telling a story but just naumbers (dehumanize?)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | <a href="https://hyp.is/aOwdeIOAEeyAk2-LiRC-XQ">https://hyp.is/aOwdeIOAEeyAk2-LiRC-XQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/aOwdeIOAEeyAk2-LiRC-XQ">https://hyp.is/aOwdeIOAEeyAk2-LiRC-XQ</a> |

Whether is 1990s or 2020s, we are all doing the same thing -- computing in humanities. That is what made the idea shine and popular.

| Jacky Chen            | 02/24/2022 | If it hadnot been for the efforts of the Internet Archive and Archive Team, an ad- hoc collective of guerrilla archivists, today we would have no recordof GeoCities. It would have meant a large gap in our collective under-standing of the early web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | When I was reading this part, I think it is a huge thing. If the data is deleted, then it is GONE. At that time, storing the scale of all data from GeoCities would not be crazely expensive -- but definately not cheap. From this example I can see how the librairan and archivists have a mind or perhaps ... obessesion in curating data. It is almost why they are here from the old data (like the burned, banned books examples to now in the Internet era). The curating technologies and ways may shift, but hey, all they are doing is one simple thing -- to keep data alive. Here is a excerpt I found online from the archivist that saved data from GeoCIties: "There’s a chance that in the 1990s, you were more familiar with neighborhoods on GeoCities than with the neighborhoods in your own town. As one of the most popular and oldest (nearly 15 years running) sites for self expression on the web, GeoCities paved the way for other sites which would offer a sense of community and networking capabilities. Because it was one of the first ways for people to freely and openly become engaged with the internet, GeoCities will always be an important part of web history. Yahoo! announced that it will close the site on October 26, 2009, steering users towards their paid service instead. We have been archiving GeoCities sites for years in our crawls, but, as goes with the territory of being web archivists, we want to make sure to gather as many of the pages as possible before the looming end of an era, 10-26-2009.

| Jacky Chen            | 02/24/2022 | The geographical community metaphor meshed well with a public that was conditioned to think of GeoCities, the renamed Beverly Hills Internet, as an ever- expanding geographical space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | When I read what was GeoCities, I was a little bit confused of what aspect made it unique: here I found a more detailed expanation on Wiki, and I think it offers a better edge to understand this concept brought by Bohnett: "In its original form, site users selected a "city" in which to list the hyperlinks to their web pages. The "cities" were named after real cities or regions according to their content – for example, computer-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to "Hollywood"; hence the name of the site. Soon after its acquisition by Yahoo!, this practice was abandoned in favour of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <a href="https://hyp.is/6yPiJJU-EeyI6FNappdXBg">https://hyp.is/6yPiJJU-EeyI6FNappdXBg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/6yPiJJU-EeyI6FNappdXBg">https://hyp.is/6yPiJJU-EeyI6FNappdXBg</a> |

| Jacky Chen            | 02/12/2022 | As a result, the mission of humanitiesdata.com is not to replace any existing resources but, rather, to increase the overall number of digital pathways to humanities data, and to make it easier to search for data by its relevance to specific subfields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | It is always good to have more sources for researchers to find data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/9NBG8IxWEeyK2y_6hn-H7Q">https://hyp.is/9NBG8IxWEeyK2y_6hn-H7Q</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/9NBG8IxWEeyK2y_6hn-H7Q">https://hyp.is/9NBG8IxWEeyK2y_6hn-H7Q</a> |

Humanists understand issues in a qualitative, critical view and justify the issue by how we see the world. Data scientists would find data, nuances and patterns and use quantitative tools to justify that how and why things happened. In some shapes of form, the two world view can be hard to merge. But just like the author mentioned: "I think that’s why digital humanities is so challenging and fun, because you’re always holding in your head this tension between the power of computation and the inadequacy of data to truly represent reality."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/rHoAyIqSEeycCXNQaoQnPg">https://hyp.is/rHoAyIqSEeycCXNQaoQnPg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/rHoAyIqSEeycCXNQaoQnPg">https://hyp.is/rHoAyIqSEeycCXNQaoQnPg</a> |

| Jacky Chen            | 02/09/2022 | Police brutality towards civilians provides a powerful example. Though policing and crime are among the most data-driven areas of public policy, traditionally there has been little history of standardized and rigorous data collected about police brutality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | This is a great example of the power we discussed in another reading.

| Jacky Chen            | 02/09/2022 | As these examples help to show, the forces that operate through the matrix of domination are sneaky and diffuse.

| Jacky Chen            | 02/03/2022 | Many strategies for sharing profits with data laborers have been developed. Profits can be distributed via direct payments – e.g. as in Microsoft’s Trove project – but can also come in the form of payments to relevant organizations (e.g. Wikipedia or “data cooperatives”) and even corporate taxes based on a company’s data dependence. Researchers and activists have also explored grassroots techniques such as “data strikes”, “conscious data contribution”, and and “data poisoning”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The sharing of profit is the most important issues that need to be solved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/GzMsMIUUEeyJZ2ckTRsn-g">https://hyp.is/GzMsMIUUEeyJZ2ckTRsn-g</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/GzMsMIUUEeyJZ2ckTRsn-g">https://hyp.is/GzMsMIUUEeyJZ2ckTRsn-g</a> |

| Jacky Chen            | 02/03/2022 | We had to use a stopword list containing tools with names that are also frequent terms, like “Processing”, and we also left out one-letter programming languages, like R and C. Especially R is quite popular in our community and it would be great to compare it to its biggest contender: Python. But this would be future work.

That's 0.86% of Louisiana’s population, or nearly 1 in 100 (the worst among all states).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Matt uses data to attract the reader's attention.

If, in the 1960s and 1970s, UNIX hardwired an emerging system of covert racism into our mainframes and our minds, then computation responds to culture as much as it controls it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | It is very interesting to read about how the creaction and design of UNIX (given the characterstics and how it functions) can create a "covert racism" in our society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <a href="https://hyp.is/39ahCH-REeyjGAPQ3S--2A">https://hyp.is/39ahCH-REeyjGAPQ3S--2A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/39ahCH-REeyjGAPQ3S--2A">https://hyp.is/39ahCH-REeyjGAPQ3S--2A</a> |
| Jacky Chen            | 01/25/2022 | Just five. Two books that have "set in stone" in their titles (and thus wouldn't need a working full-text index), one book from 2001, and two volumes of the Congressional record. 99.95% of the books that should be returned in this search--many of which, in my experience, were generally returned four years ago or so--have vanished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | It is sad to see that many results have vanished.

First thing is trust. People do not believe that the old model of selecting articles should be replaced.

It would be hard imagine for myself because it seems overwhelming. This also reminds me how metadata might be important in this case that we can sort and organize in this content. If I would have different data together with no concrete ways, I might do not know how to correlate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://hyp.is/t9FgOJkBEey9dBMzLkySSA">https://hyp.is/t9FgOJkBEey9dBMzLkySSA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/t9FgOJkBEey9dBMzLkySSA">https://hyp.is/t9FgOJkBEey9dBMzLkySSA</a> |

And all of our data is based on screenplays, not a perfect transcription of a film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | I have a small doubt here, could the order of information cause bias to the general audience?

| Yingyu Chen           | 02/07/2022 | The results: 22 of 30 Disney films have a male majority of dialogue. Even films with female leads, such as Mulan, the dialogue swings male.

| Yingyu Chen           | 02/07/2022 | That which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to. It’s in these things that we find cultural and colloquial hints of what is deemed important.

What are the meaning for open-source? and how can we make sure the effort paid by coders are not taken by others, while still active in the way it initially made for?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | <a href="https://hyp.is/8O-p8IUREeyfV7_hyLKdyg">https://hyp.is/8O-p8IUREeyfV7_hyLKdyg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/8O-p8IUREeyfV7_hyLKdyg">https://hyp.is/8O-p8IUREeyfV7_hyLKdyg</a> |

Tons of algorithms, bundled up and applied, mean that computers can fake listening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The word respond, understand, and fake listening are intriguing here because the reality of algorithm reveal the truth.

| Yingyu Chen           | 01/25/2022 | But the particular ways that it has actually eroded, including this one, are worth documenting, because it's easy to think that search tools that worked perfectly well a few years ago won't have been consciously degraded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | This reminds me of the process of iteration, that we iterate incomplete product but also easy to ignore the relatively complete one, like the 'perfect' google books a while ago. However, just like the author says, it is worth documenting. I am also thinking about other website which does the similar things, are they upgrading regularly? What if there are problems caused by the misinformation based on the incomplete information?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | <a href="https://hyp.is/kWcz0H4FEeyuA79TlWu6cQ">https://hyp.is/kWcz0H4FEeyuA79TlWu6cQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/kWcz0H4FEeyuA79TlWu6cQ">https://hyp.is/kWcz0H4FEeyuA79TlWu6cQ</a> |

| John Gadomski         | 02/28/2022 | White is not a racial identity that the Smithsonian typically tracks. Instead, the category exists as an absence that reveals a bias.22 White-ness is not critically examined by the institution. Yet it is the racial identity of the vast majority of artists whose work is shown at the Smithsonian. As this example dem-onstrates, absences are part of deeply rooted systems of representation—in this case, white supremacy—reified in data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | It is both very interesting and important that we acknowledge that data can be represented as the void that other data lacks.

| John Gadomski         | 01/26/2022 | In extending our critical methodologies, we must have at least a passing familiarity with code languages, operating systems, algorithmic thinking, and systems design. We need database literacies, algorithmic literacies, computational literacies, interface literacies. We need new hybrid practitioners: artist-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars; theoretical archivists, critical race coders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | We often forgot that the origin of computing was only representative of whites, and fails to include the voices/opinions of the oppressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/wilkbH8DEeyXuUunp0dXhA">https://hyp.is/wilkbH8DEeyXuUunp0dXhA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/wilkbH8DEeyXuUunp0dXhA">https://hyp.is/wilkbH8DEeyXuUunp0dXhA</a> |

Doing so incurs some risk that you will accidentally type junk into your data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Is this the reason why we calculate on python, pandas instead of the actual csv file?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <a href="https://hyp.is/UGCO8qASEeyen2Pacy9rEw">https://hyp.is/UGCO8qASEeyen2Pacy9rEw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/UGCO8qASEeyen2Pacy9rEw">https://hyp.is/UGCO8qASEeyen2Pacy9rEw</a> |

| ChangHo Jung          | 02/08/2022 | Websites that require information about gender as part of their account registration process almost always only provide a binary choice: “male or female.”2 For Munir, those options are insufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This is related with Design Justice that saying design for all!

| Leo Kasper            | 03/22/2022 | Big Data doesn’t belong to a distant dystopian future; it’s a commodity and an intrinsic and iconic feature of our present                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | It feels almost like we already are in a dystopian society sometimes... the way big data is used, or at least talked about, is very scary for a lot of people.

| Leo Kasper            | 03/03/2022 | Businesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | This is what makes me less worried about all this location tracking than it seems other people are. Sure, if someone at the company knew you they could theoretically see what you do in your day, but what is the likelihood of that? For some apps, I think the location tracking is worth it. This isn't to say that giving people access to the raw data is right or good or even necessary, but to me it doesn't matter that much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <a href="https://hyp.is/DsvasJsWEeyjPvdWG3v0Vw">https://hyp.is/DsvasJsWEeyjPvdWG3v0Vw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/DsvasJsWEeyjPvdWG3v0Vw">https://hyp.is/DsvasJsWEeyjPvdWG3v0Vw</a> |
| Leo Kasper            | 03/03/2022 | You thought observing the driver’s behavior would get you closer to reality, but instead you've put another layer between you and what's really going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | This is why a lot of surveillance is secret, which is pretty ethically terrible.

| Leo Kasper            | 04/05/2022 | Others, though, would be problematic. I’d be very wary of using “sentiment analysis” or anything to do with social networks without careful experimental design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | This relates to my annotation on Underwood's article. If I had to pick one area that I think will never be truly taken over by machine learning from humans because sentiment and emotion aren't something that can be truly understood by an unfeeling algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://hyp.is/vUr6JrT3EeyVR-dGXm3tqA">https://hyp.is/vUr6JrT3EeyVR-dGXm3tqA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/vUr6JrT3EeyVR-dGXm3tqA">https://hyp.is/vUr6JrT3EeyVR-dGXm3tqA</a> |

This sentence alone made me reconsider my previous conception of an internet database. Having heterogeneous datasets creates the need for a system of keeping them separate yet connected, while also being accessible. It takes skilled individuals to do this, and making a data base like this requires much more than just collecting the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <a href="https://hyp.is/6faSdpl6EeyYhDdIDDAMwg">https://hyp.is/6faSdpl6EeyYhDdIDDAMwg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/6faSdpl6EeyYhDdIDDAMwg">https://hyp.is/6faSdpl6EeyYhDdIDDAMwg</a> |

His execution, originally published in Stedman’s five-volume narrative of his time in Suriname, 2 almost immediately began to be remixed by abolitionists into eighteenth-century media, such as the Curious Adventures of Captain Stedman. For abolitionists, Neptune’s death, though narrated by Stedman, who was far from an abolitionist, offered readers necessary explanatory data. It offered neutral, stable, even quantifiable information about the depravity of bondage." The fact that this is something that reminds me a lot of current events is tragic to say the least. We have all of this data from hundreds of years ago and yet we still see things like this happening with, for example, police officers or prison guards. I wonder if this is just an inevitability or if we can use this data in a more impactful way to stop the cycle of violence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/gHzTpoOAEeyAld9k_IwykA">https://hyp.is/gHzTpoOAEeyAld9k_IwykA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/gHzTpoOAEeyAld9k_IwykA">https://hyp.is/gHzTpoOAEeyAld9k_IwykA</a> |
| Leo Kasper            | 02/24/2022 | If it hadnot been for the efforts of the Internet Archive and Archive Team, an ad- hoc collective of guerrilla archivists, today we would have no recordof GeoCities. It would have meant a large gap in our collective under-standing of the early web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | I really did not think about the magnitude of this until I read this paragraph. It makes sense why Yahoo! would delete the data--why would they want to pay to maintain a dead web service? However, they could have given better notice or at least worked alongside the archive team to preserve this important slice of internet history. It seems no thought or care was given to this process on the part of Yahoo!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <a href="https://hyp.is/d2GjupWLEeyw2F_ZkL_kow">https://hyp.is/d2GjupWLEeyw2F_ZkL_kow</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/d2GjupWLEeyw2F_ZkL_kow">https://hyp.is/d2GjupWLEeyw2F_ZkL_kow</a> |

| Leo Kasper            | 02/10/2022 | To put this prevalence in concrete numbers, more than 15,000 Goodreads reviews explicitly mentioned the words "classic" or "classics," while just under 400 reviews mentioned the words "canon" or "canonical."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | I have mostly heard the term "canon" used in reference to something being a part of a story or something of that nature rather than being interchangeable with "classic" so this doesn't surprise me. Most Goodreads readers are just regular people who don't pay attention to the lingo of scholars, so I don't really understand the point that this article is trying to make with that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <a href="https://hyp.is/1oEvFoqKEeyPgh83WMmwzg">https://hyp.is/1oEvFoqKEeyPgh83WMmwzg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/1oEvFoqKEeyPgh83WMmwzg">https://hyp.is/1oEvFoqKEeyPgh83WMmwzg</a> |

| Leo Kasper            | 02/03/2022 | This man makes a third less than you, and his education ended with a B.S. from a large, perfectly fine state university. But he has 500+ connections on LinkedIn. That plus sign after the “500” bothers you. How many more than 500 people does he know? Five?

| Leo Kasper            | 01/27/2022 | many in the membership of the ASA treat computation within the humanities with some level of suspicion, perceiving it to be complicit with the corporatization of higher education or as primarily technological rather than scholarly.3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This shocked me to read, especially considering we are talking about the 21st century. By 2008 when this was published, I'd think that scholars of all disciplines would have embraced computation in all fields, but I guess this wasn't the case.

| Sam Kremerman         | 04/14/2022 | To get entities with Stanford NLP, you have to run a memory-hungry Java program from the command line, with all the joy that comes from setting that up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Although a joke, this statement does a good job of emphasizing one of the key differences between Python and Java. The memory requirement to run Java is much greater than Python which is an important reason for why one may view it as a better programming language for data analytics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <a href="https://hyp.is/hsuVNLvGEey6FPNQqzv1vw">https://hyp.is/hsuVNLvGEey6FPNQqzv1vw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/hsuVNLvGEey6FPNQqzv1vw">https://hyp.is/hsuVNLvGEey6FPNQqzv1vw</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 05/11/2022 | This is not simply to say that humanities scholars need to be trained to be statistically savvy, but that students entering STEM pathways need to also be alert to the complexity and interest of arts and humanities data and to the critical skills those disciplines provide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | It seems to be a very common belief between different fields that the ability to understand the fields through different lenses (ex.

| Sam Kremerman         | 05/10/2022 | I can't make myself explicit in the models that I build without explicitly acknowledging my (white, cis, straight, female) body. My cognitive processes — the way that I think and write and build models — are circumscribed by my experiences as a body in the world, and the products of my thinking and writing are received as an extension of that body. The two cannot be disentangled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | I think that this should be noted in a lot of fields of study as there may be implicit bias's that people have that can affect how the research/work is done and analyzed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/AniuEtChEey0J-_KOG_zag">https://hyp.is/AniuEtChEey0J-_KOG_zag</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/AniuEtChEey0J-_KOG_zag">https://hyp.is/AniuEtChEey0J-_KOG_zag</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 03/22/2022 | I have multiplied the E-I ratio by -1 to essentially give opposite results. Neither results seems particularly surprising, once we’ve constructed a just-so story to rationalize the answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | This really shows how easy and common it is for people to rationalize data and data visualizations in a way that always supports their points of view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <a href="https://hyp.is/Xsx7CKnrEeyWbRMcJ9kfqQ">https://hyp.is/Xsx7CKnrEeyWbRMcJ9kfqQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/Xsx7CKnrEeyWbRMcJ9kfqQ">https://hyp.is/Xsx7CKnrEeyWbRMcJ9kfqQ</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 03/22/2022 | The problem is that often it is not possible to know what a visualization would look like in advance, and so it should not be possible immediately after seeing it to explain it as something that we already know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | This somewhat directly counters the points in "Data Humanism, The Revolution will be visualized" about current data visualizations being too confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <a href="https://hyp.is/DR6-8qnqEey4a1u8ZJ66xA">https://hyp.is/DR6-8qnqEey4a1u8ZJ66xA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/DR6-8qnqEey4a1u8ZJ66xA">https://hyp.is/DR6-8qnqEey4a1u8ZJ66xA</a> |

Failing to represent these limitations and nuances and blindly putting numbers in a chart is like reviewing a movie by analyzing the chemical properties of the cellulose on which the images were recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I think this point about blindly putting numbers in a chart is rather important going into the data collection phase of a lot of our final projects,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/UKOWTqnpEeyfkD9dJzLONw">https://hyp.is/UKOWTqnpEeyfkD9dJzLONw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/UKOWTqnpEeyfkD9dJzLONw">https://hyp.is/UKOWTqnpEeyfkD9dJzLONw</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 03/10/2022 | The term “cleaning” implies that a data set is “messy.” “Messy” suggests an underlying order. It supposes things already have a rightful place, but they’re not in it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | This makes a really interesting point about how there isn't really any "clean" or "messy" data. It makes me wonder what biases may be introduced into data sets as a result of data cleaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | <a href="https://hyp.is/QoXY9qCTEey6G3tGRzw0tw">https://hyp.is/QoXY9qCTEey6G3tGRzw0tw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/QoXY9qCTEey6G3tGRzw0tw">https://hyp.is/QoXY9qCTEey6G3tGRzw0tw</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 03/03/2022 | But information about people retains its power as long as those people are alive, and sometimes as long as their children are alive. No one knows what will become of sites like Twitter in five years or ten.

| Sam Kremerman         | 05/03/2022 | But to prepare students for this new world, we need to do more than wag our fingers and warn them that algorithms are problematic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | It seems like this has been a pretty common trend in my educational path up to this point. I have consistently been warned about the problems that occur with algorithms and machine learning. However, it seems as though there has been little taught as to how to counteract these problems.

Ingestion grapples with how to collect and store heterogeneous data sets.5 Interoperability considers how to make those data speak to one another.6 Enrichment contends with how to add more infor-mation to ingested records.7 And finally, interface has to do with how to make those records accessible and actionable.8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | This in depth description of data infrastructures is very intriguing and makes me wonder how they are applied within different modern industries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/eEHUpJnqEeyKXsfxKN-IPQ">https://hyp.is/eEHUpJnqEeyKXsfxKN-IPQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/eEHUpJnqEeyKXsfxKN-IPQ">https://hyp.is/eEHUpJnqEeyKXsfxKN-IPQ</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/22/2022 | Contemporary readers not only use the term "classic," they use it a lot and often have strong feelings about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | It's interesting how loosely the term "classic" is used among non-academic readers as I am currently taking a classics course right now, CLCV224, and the definition of classics in that class is an ancient Greek or Roman piece of literature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <a href="https://hyp.is/Beu9cJP_EeyswkdTIlBHeQ">https://hyp.is/Beu9cJP_EeyswkdTIlBHeQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/Beu9cJP_EeyswkdTIlBHeQ">https://hyp.is/Beu9cJP_EeyswkdTIlBHeQ</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/17/2022 | Over the next two decades, a number of similar initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic sought to bring together collections of digital texts, includ-ing the Oxford Text Archive (1972), the Perseus Digital Library (1987), and the Women Writers Project (1988), the former representing the old canon, while the latter was a product of rising interest in women’s history at that time, and a glimpse into early priorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | I did not know that the collection of digital texts was such a long standing field, dating back to at least 1972.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/EKU_kpATEeyf14vVXcVVmg">https://hyp.is/EKU_kpATEeyf14vVXcVVmg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/EKU_kpATEeyf14vVXcVVmg">https://hyp.is/EKU_kpATEeyf14vVXcVVmg</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/08/2022 | The word "missing" is inherently normative. It implies both a lack and an ought: something does not exist, but it should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | I am confused as to what normative means in this scenerio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/A2QW-IiVEey4qP9EEz0mZg">https://hyp.is/A2QW-IiVEey4qP9EEz0mZg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/A2QW-IiVEey4qP9EEz0mZg">https://hyp.is/A2QW-IiVEey4qP9EEz0mZg</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/08/2022 | Websites that require information about gender as part of their account registration process almost always only provide a binary choice: “male or female.”2 For Munir, those options are insufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | I have definitely noticed how this binary option pops up on websites.

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/08/2022 | These numbers are probably not a surprise. The more surprising thing is that those numbers are getting worse, not better. According to a research report published by the American Association of University Women in 2015, women computer science graduates in the United States peaked in the mid-1980s at 37 percent, and we have seen a steady decline in the years since then to 26 percent today (figure 1.2).26 As “data analysts” (low-status number crunchers) have become rebranded as “data scientists” (high status researchers), women are being pushed out in order to make room for more highly valued and more highly compensated men.                                                                                                  | This relates to conversations we had earlier in the semester about how it is necessary to have a diverse group of people when making technological innovations. This is even more concerning as in this scenario the diversity is trending in the wrong direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://hyp.is/Cix8SIiOEeylAf8eKY2Mfg">https://hyp.is/Cix8SIiOEeylAf8eKY2Mfg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/Cix8SIiOEeylAf8eKY2Mfg">https://hyp.is/Cix8SIiOEeylAf8eKY2Mfg</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/03/2022 | Many strategies for sharing profits with data laborers have been developed. Profits can be distributed via direct payments – e.g. as in Microsoft’s Trove project – but can also come in the form of payments to relevant organizations (e.g. Wikipedia or “data cooperatives”) and even corporate taxes based on a company’s data dependence. Researchers and activists have also explored grassroots techniques such as “data strikes”, “conscious data contribution”, and and “data poisoning”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | These seem like good preliminary solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <a href="https://hyp.is/Piiw7oTSEeyOc5-ZfyH_ew">https://hyp.is/Piiw7oTSEeyOc5-ZfyH_ew</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/Piiw7oTSEeyOc5-ZfyH_ew">https://hyp.is/Piiw7oTSEeyOc5-ZfyH_ew</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/03/2022 | This time you stop yourself. You don’t want your inquiry to be met by a patronizing sigh of impatience or another explanation about ship dates, Agile cycles, and continuous delivery. Better for now to hide your ignorance. When will it be done? You are learning to accept that the answer for software projects is never.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | This whole introductory passage seems to be a satire about how older business people are struggling to adapt to the new technological revolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/l1KFaITOEeyQGwMx3BlnoQ">https://hyp.is/l1KFaITOEeyQGwMx3BlnoQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/l1KFaITOEeyQGwMx3BlnoQ">https://hyp.is/l1KFaITOEeyQGwMx3BlnoQ</a> |
| Sam Kremerman         | 02/01/2022 | Much of the site is built with classrooms and non-academic users in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | I think this is important as a lot of databases are crafted in a way that make it difficult for people who haven't gone through higher education to access the information.

| Sam Kremerman         | 02/01/2022 | Today, the debate surrounding race and incarceration is vast and complex. In 1910, they story was more straightforward, sometimes even more explicit. Even those who debate the role of systemic racism today have to face the obvious fact: we still see the shadow of the undeniable, institutionalized, strategic racism of the 100 years after the Civil War.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | It seems like it is a vastly accepted fact in the humanities communities that today's incarceration rates of African American's have been largely effected by slavery and Jim Crow. How do you think humanitarian's can use this knowledge in order to cause the political and social change necessary to start to fix this problem?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/Ifq1PoMzEeyjixdMUqOMAg">https://hyp.is/Ifq1PoMzEeyjixdMUqOMAg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/Ifq1PoMzEeyjixdMUqOMAg">https://hyp.is/Ifq1PoMzEeyjixdMUqOMAg</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 01/27/2022 | I am not arguing that the programmers creating UNIX at Bell Labs and in Berkeley were consciously encoding new modes of racism and racial understanding into digital systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I think "consciously" is an important word here.

This is a problem that could have been solved by having a more diverse group of members on ones development team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <a href="https://hyp.is/2rzOAn-OEey4XgtKeRNLoQ">https://hyp.is/2rzOAn-OEey4XgtKeRNLoQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/2rzOAn-OEey4XgtKeRNLoQ">https://hyp.is/2rzOAn-OEey4XgtKeRNLoQ</a> |
| Sam Kremerman         | 01/27/2022 | I will argue that the difficulties we encounter in knitting together our discussions of race (or other modes of difference) with our technological productions within the digital humanities (or in our studies of code) are actually an effect of the very designs of our technological systems, designs that emerged in post–World War II computational culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | I find this to be a very interesting point as in IS202, we discussed how a lot of technological productions are made by groups of primarily white people which results in the designs being made for primarily white people whether intentional or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <a href="https://hyp.is/El1SSH-NEey26YcEoM6pTw">https://hyp.is/El1SSH-NEey26YcEoM6pTw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/El1SSH-NEey26YcEoM6pTw">https://hyp.is/El1SSH-NEey26YcEoM6pTw</a> |
| Sam Kremerman         | 01/25/2022 | If I worked at Google, I would have implemented a text-based date-prediction algorithm to flag erroneously classified books. (I have actually done this and sent a list to the HathiTurst of books they may have erroneously released into the public domain. It works).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | I am surprised that Google hasn't done this yet. What may be the reason for this? Could it possibly just be a lack of commitment of resources to Google Books as it does still have pre-2012 branding and an abandoned stay tuned message?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/CpL4Zn38EeyOY6Oa5qv6NQ">https://hyp.is/CpL4Zn38EeyOY6Oa5qv6NQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/CpL4Zn38EeyOY6Oa5qv6NQ">https://hyp.is/CpL4Zn38EeyOY6Oa5qv6NQ</a> |

| Sam Kremerman         | 01/25/2022 | we make no assumptions at all about veracity. Electronic data, like the data of the early modern period, is given. It may be that the data we collect and transmit has no relation to truth or reality whatsoever beyond the reality that data helps us to construct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | This brings up an interesting point on data not always being related to truth. This could be seen in a situation such as having a bias data algorithm where it may make bias decisions as a result of bias decisions that have already been made. An example of this bias would be a hiring algorithm ruling out the resume's from female dominated schools as a lot of the current successful employees may be from male dominated schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="https://hyp.is/YhyLWH31EeymEZ-3ep6MjA">https://hyp.is/YhyLWH31EeymEZ-3ep6MjA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/YhyLWH31EeymEZ-3ep6MjA">https://hyp.is/YhyLWH31EeymEZ-3ep6MjA</a> |

Will everything be able to be represented by a number, or will there be some things that just need words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://hyp.is/GXAdxsTkEeyysIseMdExyQ">https://hyp.is/GXAdxsTkEeyysIseMdExyQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/GXAdxsTkEeyysIseMdExyQ">https://hyp.is/GXAdxsTkEeyysIseMdExyQ</a> |
| Braden Monahan        | 03/22/2022 | we are so damn good at coming up with post-facto historical explanations to contextualize any given observation, that we are particularly susceptible to confabulating these post-facto rationalizations with the idea that we somehow knew the results of this quantitative work already                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | This seems to be the main argument of the article and makes me think about many of the things I have learned and taken at face value.

| Braden Monahan        | 03/09/2022 | The term “cleaning” implies that a data set is “messy.” “Messy” suggests an underlying order. It supposes things already have a rightful place, but they’re not in it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | I think this is one of the main and most powerful arguments in the piece. It is also similar to some of the things we read earlier in the semester about missing data sets and how they were not in their rightful place                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <a href="https://hyp.is/UdmC4p_rEeyr-Yuasie6zA">https://hyp.is/UdmC4p_rEeyr-Yuasie6zA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/UdmC4p_rEeyr-Yuasie6zA">https://hyp.is/UdmC4p_rEeyr-Yuasie6zA</a> |

One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | This makes me wonder if this tracking info could be obtained by a police department to find criminals.

| Braden Monahan        | 02/02/2022 | This is why, despite the hype, it’s silly to say Facebook has an algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | This reminds me of TikTok.

Data can simply be lost if society at all cares about the topic: Sometimes society doesn't care about a topic no matter the importance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <a href="https://hyp.is/I0ZZJpmAEeyTLbtg1uEYIw">https://hyp.is/I0ZZJpmAEeyTLbtg1uEYIw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/I0ZZJpmAEeyTLbtg1uEYIw">https://hyp.is/I0ZZJpmAEeyTLbtg1uEYIw</a> |
| Yuto Nakagawa         | 03/01/2022 | This is where their structures start to diverge noticeably. Georgia’s subcompart-ments include “GA Obituaries,” “1730-1842,” “Civil Rights Digital Library,” “Georgia Government Publications,” and a large subcollection confusingly labeled the same way as the higher-level contain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | It's interesting to see how niche and specific these collections can be.

| Yuto Nakagawa         | 02/24/2022 | The same desire for connectivity was there, expressed through content, hyperlinks and guest books. Instead of showing appreciation through a ‘heart’ on Twitter, or a ‘like’ on Facebook, a handmade Microsoft Paint award was there: more meaningful, per-haps, given the level of detail needed to successfully spread this sort of community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The foundation of the internet has never changed, but adapted for QOL.

| Yuto Nakagawa         | 02/10/2022 | With a source, like a film or a work of literature, you’re not extracting features in order to analyze them; you’re trying to dive into it, like a pool, and understand it from within.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Although not ideal in every situation, having a polar perspective gives diversity to researching.

| Yuto Nakagawa         | 02/01/2022 | There is a time-lapse feature that displays the selected voyages as they move across the Atlantic one venture at a time – the complete slave trade can be viewed in just four minutes. Pausing the animation and then hovering over a voyage reveals summary details and gives a link back to the main user interface where users can inspect the full information on the voyage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | This feature itself is extremely underrated when implemented as it shows effort to timeline the all voyages along with a user interface that makes viewing as accessible as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <a href="https://hyp.is/9Ja1FoMoEeyJD3tbzAdv_A">https://hyp.is/9Ja1FoMoEeyJD3tbzAdv_A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/9Ja1FoMoEeyJD3tbzAdv_A">https://hyp.is/9Ja1FoMoEeyJD3tbzAdv_A</a> |

There is definitely a correlation between the black population and incarceration rate, but putting it into visuals is extremely helpful. The only gripe I have of these visuals is the noticeable delay with transitions. This might be due to my software, but I would be surprised with hardware as the desktop that this note is being written on should handle the transitions no problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | <a href="https://hyp.is/0z6HnoMpEeyjPKcbFYOg-A">https://hyp.is/0z6HnoMpEeyjPKcbFYOg-A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/0z6HnoMpEeyjPKcbFYOg-A">https://hyp.is/0z6HnoMpEeyjPKcbFYOg-A</a> |
| Yuto Nakagawa         | 01/27/2022 | the concept of file folders and directories, essential to previous generations’ understanding of computers, is gibberish to many modern students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | To be honest, I thought modern students nowadays understood directories and folders, but this article refutes that completely.

| Yuto Nakagawa         | 01/27/2022 | Let me be clear. By drawing analogies between shifting racial and political formations and the emerging structures of digital computing in the late 1960s, I am not arguing that the programmers creating UNIX at Bell Labs and in Berkeley were consciously encoding new modes of racism and racial understanding into digital systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Implicit bias shows even through projects that initially do not seem related to race, but history shows otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://hyp.is/6z9Npn8tEey0tptx298jjg">https://hyp.is/6z9Npn8tEey0tptx298jjg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/6z9Npn8tEey0tptx298jjg">https://hyp.is/6z9Npn8tEey0tptx298jjg</a> |

| Jerry Xu              | 03/22/2022 | we are so damn good at coming up with post-facto historical explanations to contextualize any given observation, that we are particularly susceptible to confabulating these post-facto rationalizations with the idea that we somehow knew the results of this quantitative work already                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Is this saying we are always trying to explain the result using our assumptions instead of actually analyze using historical facts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | <a href="https://hyp.is/rtCCrqnpEey4YhsTNC-vZw">https://hyp.is/rtCCrqnpEey4YhsTNC-vZw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/rtCCrqnpEey4YhsTNC-vZw">https://hyp.is/rtCCrqnpEey4YhsTNC-vZw</a> |

| Jerry Xu              | 03/03/2022 | An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The user acknowledgement is usually vague or too complicated for the user to understand.

| Jerry Xu              | 02/15/2022 | On Goodreads, internet users can categorize any book as a "classic" and publish their own responses to it — gushing praise, mean takedowns, critical analyses, snarky parodies, personal narratives, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Is this going to be issue?

| Jerry Xu              | 02/03/2022 | The hardest work in programming is getting around things that aren’t computable, in finding ways to break impossible tasks into small, possible components, and then creating the impression that the computer is doing something it actually isn’t, like having a human conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This is a summary of what programmers are doing. They solve the problem, translate it into language that computers understand, and hope the computers run on those instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <a href="https://hyp.is/pwQ6toUOEeyRKwe2bdsWmQ">https://hyp.is/pwQ6toUOEeyRKwe2bdsWmQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/pwQ6toUOEeyRKwe2bdsWmQ">https://hyp.is/pwQ6toUOEeyRKwe2bdsWmQ</a> |

| Jerry Xu              | 01/27/2022 | In extending our critical methodologies, we must have at least a passing familiarity with code languages, operating systems, algorithmic thinking, and systems design. We need database literacies, algorithmic literacies, computational literacies, interface literacies. We need new hybrid practitioners: artist-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars; theoretical archivists, critical race coders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The author got a really interesting point here.

I think this is a really interesting point. The word "evidence", "truth" has inherited meaning that indicates the things it uses to explain something is true according to the evidence or truth founds. However, I think the term "data" itself doesn't have true or false meaning. Rather, it is true or false based on contexts (maybe metadata).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="https://hyp.is/-4Vaan4qEeyVtpM-qg659A">https://hyp.is/-4Vaan4qEeyVtpM-qg659A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/-4Vaan4qEeyVtpM-qg659A">https://hyp.is/-4Vaan4qEeyVtpM-qg659A</a> |

I think this is a fascinating idea, which everyone will be able to access books and information online for some price (for free?). However, how is google going to categorized every piece of information and have it indexed the correct way? Also, how is google books going to solve the digital divide problem where not everyone has equal access to internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <a href="https://hyp.is/gdGkrn4pEeym1wu8AH_K6A">https://hyp.is/gdGkrn4pEeym1wu8AH_K6A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/gdGkrn4pEeym1wu8AH_K6A">https://hyp.is/gdGkrn4pEeym1wu8AH_K6A</a> |
| Jerry Xu              | 01/20/2022 | The algorithm’s methods all work by identifying groups of words that have a very high likelihood of coexisting near one another within the sentences, paragraphs, and whole books composing the archives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | By using text analysis algorithm, we can find "relationship" in words, and thus finding similarity or connection in certain topics.

| Arnav Lande           | 02/10/2022 | Once we had completed our data biography, it became clear that some of the trends we had seen that looked like significant changes in violence rates were actually variations in the data collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | I think its interesting how the background of the data (or the lack of data points) can influence the visual outcomes.

| Dharra Prashaad       | 04/11/2022 | Yeah, I know that novels have structure, but your average plain-text file of a novel’s text – even if it maintains chapter headers and such – doesn’t have the kind of structure that a computer can easily read. I mean, it’s not like it’s a spreadsheet or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | I thought that this was a really good thing to note--even when we can see structured data, our computers may not be able to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="https://hyp.is/SjzB4rm0EeyULzsuOOVkyw">https://hyp.is/SjzB4rm0EeyULzsuOOVkyw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/SjzB4rm0EeyULzsuOOVkyw">https://hyp.is/SjzB4rm0EeyULzsuOOVkyw</a> |
| Dharra Prashaad       | 04/25/2022 | Until such massive structural changes are addressed (if they can be), we need to think practically about how to bridge the quantitative and qualitative spheres, working with the system and the expertise that we have and gaining additional skills and experience where we can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not a fix but I think a sign things are going in the direction the author wants is how employers from either field (STEM or the humanities) talk about the other field. For example, I am in IS 199 right now and a lot of employers talk about wanting "well rounded" candidates or have special programs for those with humanities backgrounds to gain STEM skills and come work for them (a STEM-focused company).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <a href="https://hyp.is/1BlvEMTVEeyIZludGmlq0A">https://hyp.is/1BlvEMTVEeyIZludGmlq0A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/1BlvEMTVEeyIZludGmlq0A">https://hyp.is/1BlvEMTVEeyIZludGmlq0A</a> |
| Dharra Prashaad       | 04/25/2022 | The question is not whether metadata contains everything a historian might need, but under what circumstances the metadata by itself is still sufficient to reveal something historiographically notable and trustworthy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | I guess this makes sense to me, but I wonder how the metadata's context plays into this as well. Is context separate from it or just like a larger view of the metadata?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <a href="https://hyp.is/fbRm_MTVEeyTaSOyHKykYw">https://hyp.is/fbRm_MTVEeyTaSOyHKykYw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/fbRm_MTVEeyTaSOyHKykYw">https://hyp.is/fbRm_MTVEeyTaSOyHKykYw</a> |
| Dharra Prashaad       | 04/25/2022 | Letters offer perhaps the most intuitive way of reconstructing analogue communication networks. Scholars in the field of epistolary studies have increasingly turned to network analysis and visualisation methods, and all of the authors of this book have worked on this material over the past decade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | thinking of a story or network revealing itself through individual accounts or letters reminds me of how sometimes novels use different perspectives through emails/interviews/interrogations to convey the plot (the main one coming to me now is "Anxious People" by Fredrik Backman).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <a href="https://hyp.is/JlU8asTVEey7casEZsLsQQ">https://hyp.is/JlU8asTVEey7casEZsLsQQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/JlU8asTVEey7casEZsLsQQ">https://hyp.is/JlU8asTVEey7casEZsLsQQ</a> |

| Dharra Prashaad       | 03/20/2022 | If I can come up with two perfectly plausible historical scenarios to explain opposing, hypothetical trends, then we clearly don’t have a settled answer to the question already, and it was entirely worth my time to try and run that humanistic experiment to at least find the actual trend before I began to formulate any conclusions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Wait, this is such a good argument for having quantitative research in the humanities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <a href="https://hyp.is/KD5uWKiCEeyumaeiTeLgCA">https://hyp.is/KD5uWKiCEeyumaeiTeLgCA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/KD5uWKiCEeyumaeiTeLgCA">https://hyp.is/KD5uWKiCEeyumaeiTeLgCA</a> |
| Dharra Prashaad       | 03/20/2022 | The sense that a visualization is immediately explainable is the result, I think, of the ability of visualizations to rapidly and persuasively communicate large amounts of information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | I've never thought about the negative aspects of data that is visualized well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <a href="https://hyp.is/08ZMZKiCEeyUfOu6Yi3glw">https://hyp.is/08ZMZKiCEeyUfOu6Yi3glw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/08ZMZKiCEeyUfOu6Yi3glw">https://hyp.is/08ZMZKiCEeyUfOu6Yi3glw</a> |

| Dharra Prashaad       | 03/29/2022 | Why are humanists using computers to understand text at all? Part of the point of the phrase “digital humanities” is to claim information technology as something that belongs in the humanities — not an invader from some other field. And it’s true, humanistic interpretation has always had a technological dimension: we organized writing with commonplace books and concordances before we took up keyword search [Nowviskie, 2004; Stallybrass, 2007].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | It seems like a lot of our readings start off like this.

I think this is such a cool way of looking at data. Instead of just seeing what data consists of on a surface level, we can look at the way it was categorized, the way it was preserved, what was preserved, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <a href="https://hyp.is/otnXDpdAEey20RNGwe5O4A">https://hyp.is/otnXDpdAEey20RNGwe5O4A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/otnXDpdAEey20RNGwe5O4A">https://hyp.is/otnXDpdAEey20RNGwe5O4A</a> |

IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate "privacy settings" section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called "location settings" made no mention of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | This made me switch from using "my location" to Champaign in the weather app on my phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <a href="https://hyp.is/a7r0rphBEeyrYIOevshPIA">https://hyp.is/a7r0rphBEeyrYIOevshPIA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/a7r0rphBEeyrYIOevshPIA">https://hyp.is/a7r0rphBEeyrYIOevshPIA</a> |

Saved by the concerted efforts of the Internet Archive, which has a few scrapes going back to the late 1990s, and the Herculean end- of- life efforts of the Archive Team, the digital ruins of this once mighty community today offer rich terrain for historians to explore                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | I mentioned this in the blog posting about the reading but it is weird to think that something that had such a presence like GeoCities did is almost obsolete today, and without people consciously attempting to preserve it, it would be unavailable for many of us to study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | <a href="https://hyp.is/HlSEkJT1Eey__0vGIWjxOg">https://hyp.is/HlSEkJT1Eey__0vGIWjxOg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/HlSEkJT1Eey__0vGIWjxOg">https://hyp.is/HlSEkJT1Eey__0vGIWjxOg</a> |

| Dharra Prashaad       | 02/18/2022 | With more than 120 million members, Goodreads is the largest social networking site for readers on the internet and a subsidiary of Amazon, one of the wealthiest and most influential corporations in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | I didn't know Goodreads was a subsidiary of Amazon.

| Dharra Prashaad       | 02/18/2022 | Saved by the concerted efforts of the Internet Archive, which has a few scrapes going back to the late 1990s, and the Herculean end-of-life efforts of the Archive Team, today the digital ruins of this once mighty community offer rich terrain for historians to explore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | This reminds me of the obsolescence mentioned in an earlier reading.

It also offers users many options to display and analyze the data that interests them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | I think this is a major plus of the website. That users can create their own data visualization products and choose which data to include or exclude?

Do they really mean any American or did they exclude groups of people based on race/ethnicity/gender?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <a href="https://hyp.is/PK-jxH2QEey1VpdYgB-1yg">https://hyp.is/PK-jxH2QEey1VpdYgB-1yg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/PK-jxH2QEey1VpdYgB-1yg">https://hyp.is/PK-jxH2QEey1VpdYgB-1yg</a> |

I can understand how this could be bad (libraries not providing sources they believe in/believe to be true could cause users to be lost or misinformed) but did it also help give voice to those who couldn't afford or were excluded from peer-reviewed journals or sources like that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/-c1bxH2OEeyrGb83AAN1Cw">https://hyp.is/-c1bxH2OEeyrGb83AAN1Cw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/-c1bxH2OEeyrGb83AAN1Cw">https://hyp.is/-c1bxH2OEeyrGb83AAN1Cw</a> |

| Dharra Prashaad       | 01/20/2022 | both famous and obscure—we found that the Anthropocene era and the global movement of life that triggered a global drop in carbon dioxide identified by scientists at the time was not a byproduct of colonialism. It was the motivation for colonialism itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | This was a great way to point out this finding.

These range from the annihilation of privacy to algorithmic racism to a rapidly warming climate—the world’s data centers, for instance, put about as much carbon into the atmosphere as air travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This is one thing that we omit when referencing data, it is becoming a physical resource with waste associated with it, at this point nothing is safe from becoming garbage, or in this case a data lake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <a href="https://hyp.is/x8-evsV1Eey0tx9tz15dEQ">https://hyp.is/x8-evsV1Eey0tx9tz15dEQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/x8-evsV1Eey0tx9tz15dEQ">https://hyp.is/x8-evsV1Eey0tx9tz15dEQ</a> |
| Caroline Stoklosinski | 04/26/2022 | Rather, big data describes a particular way of acquiring and organizing information that is increasingly indispensable to the economy as a whole. When you think about big data, you shouldn’t just think about Google and Facebook; you should think about manufacturing and retail and logistics and healthcare. You should think about pretty much everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not only does this show that we are too far into a world where we cannot live without data, it shows that nowhere is safe without the surveillance we see everywhere. So, not only are social media sites trying to gather as much data on us as it can, but that in turns means everything that we know today is built solely on data. It seems like the third wave represented in the Magna Carta, the information age, or in this case I would even argue for it to be considered a data age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <a href="https://hyp.is/lT-casV1EeyXnDsY7-fU-Q">https://hyp.is/lT-casV1EeyXnDsY7-fU-Q</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/lT-casV1EeyXnDsY7-fU-Q">https://hyp.is/lT-casV1EeyXnDsY7-fU-Q</a> |
| Caroline Stoklosinski | 04/26/2022 | Like so many other U.S. land laws, the text of the Morrill Act left out something important: the fact that these grants depended on dispossession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The text taken from the Morril act here also goes to emphasize the fact that the amount of land that each university received as 'seed money' from the government was based on how many senators the state in question had at its deposition, so the more old white men, who had nothing to do, and also contributed in the defamation of these lands, the more land the university was given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <a href="https://hyp.is/M4RjRMV0EeykqU-ZGjUEPA">https://hyp.is/M4RjRMV0EeykqU-ZGjUEPA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/M4RjRMV0EeykqU-ZGjUEPA">https://hyp.is/M4RjRMV0EeykqU-ZGjUEPA</a> |

| Caroline Stoklosinski | 04/05/2022 | So in working with the online behemoths, realize that the behavioral data they collect is not consensual. There can be no consent to mass surveillance. These business models, and the social norm of collecting everything, are still fragile. By lending your prestige to them, you legitimize them and make them more likely to endure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | This is an interesting notion, one that I never understood til my parents told me to never post things on social media, or to use a fake name whenever you are on it. Coming from an immigrant family, I feel like American society is much different than what other countries think, and this is embodied in this idea of privacy laws and social media presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | <a href="https://hyp.is/R3Rj9LSeEeyo1Afj6U7eHA">https://hyp.is/R3Rj9LSeEeyo1Afj6U7eHA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/R3Rj9LSeEeyo1Afj6U7eHA">https://hyp.is/R3Rj9LSeEeyo1Afj6U7eHA</a> |
| Caroline Stoklosinski | 04/05/2022 | Not a single illustrative quotation refers to a woman, or uses female pronouns, when describing a person who has charisma; the charismatic leaders listed are all white.4 And so I applaud the rejection of "charisma" as a force that governs scholarly engagement.

| Caroline Stoklosinski | 03/29/2022 | “text analysis” or “distant reading” is really an interdisciplinary conversation about methods, and if you get drawn into the conversation, you may find that you want to try a lot of things that aren’t packaged yet as tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | I like the idea that text analysis and distant reading are considered interdisciplinary methods here.

A group of people with different interests can just pour a collection of texts into the computer, gather round, and see what patterns emerge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not only is this an interesting notion, but it also makes us try to understand that not everything needs to be fully structured for patterns and proper analysis to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/K0m9YK8gEeywI585cQ5KGg">https://hyp.is/K0m9YK8gEeywI585cQ5KGg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/K0m9YK8gEeywI585cQ5KGg">https://hyp.is/K0m9YK8gEeywI585cQ5KGg</a> |
| Caroline Stoklosinski | 03/22/2022 | I suppose the point of this post is to articulate my growing concern that we are so damn good at coming up with post-facto historical explanations to contextualize any given observation, that we are particularly susceptible to confabulating these post-facto rationalizations with the idea that we somehow knew the results of this quantitative work already                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | This is an interesting notion, since I think we do this all the time, not only with historical data, but with any data.

| Caroline Stoklosinski | 03/10/2022 | Spreadsheets, for all of their mundane rectangularness, have been the subject of angst and controversy for decades. Some writers have admonished that “real programmers don’t use spreadsheets” and that we must “stop that subversive spreadsheet” (Casimir 1992Casimir, R. J. (1992), “Real Programmers Don’t Use Spreadsheets,” SIGPLAN Not., 27, 10–16. [Crossref], [Google Scholar]; Chadwick 2003Chadwick, D. (2003), “Stop That Subversive Spreadsheet!” in Integrity and Internal Control in Information Systems V, ed. M. Gertz, IFIP—the International Federation for Information Processing 124.

[Crossref], [Google Scholar]). | This is interesting since in my courses here at UIUC, particularly even in programming courses, they have said that programming is both a science and an art, but that is subjective you and how you chose to do things. If you prefer to do things one way, lets say in that rigid way, like spreadsheet, you are free to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/CpMsZKCTEeyK8IuKt14Ycw">https://hyp.is/CpMsZKCTEeyK8IuKt14Ycw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/CpMsZKCTEeyK8IuKt14Ycw">https://hyp.is/CpMsZKCTEeyK8IuKt14Ycw</a> |
| Caroline Stoklosinski | 03/10/2022 | With those communities in mind and even in dialogue, we would ask, what are the concepts that structure this data? And how can this data, structured in this way, point to other people’s data? This way of thinking allows us to see the messiness of data not as a block to scalability but as a vital feature of the world which our data represents and from which it emerges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | These question guide an interesting way of thinking about data in a different light, particularly in the way of what it represents at the moment, so the way so society and how we can change data to fit our standards, but everyone will always have a different way of ordering things and "cleaning" them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <a href="https://hyp.is/vuWtfqCREeyY6y8-BbCUHA">https://hyp.is/vuWtfqCREeyY6y8-BbCUHA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/vuWtfqCREeyY6y8-BbCUHA">https://hyp.is/vuWtfqCREeyY6y8-BbCUHA</a> |
| Caroline Stoklosinski | 03/10/2022 | The term “cleaning” implies that a data set is “messy.” “Messy” suggests an underlying order. It supposes things already have a rightful place, but they’re not in it—like socks on the bedroom floor rather than in the wardrobe or the laundry hamper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This is quite the literal terminology of messy. I think there are two different ways of thinking of this. One in terms of "cleaning" as a way to get rid of the unnecessary items, and "cleaning" to fix a mess. In the case of data, I would argue that humanists or even those doing the data cleaning are utilizing the first definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="https://hyp.is/Q8y6yqCQEeyLwc-oA1kV-A">https://hyp.is/Q8y6yqCQEeyLwc-oA1kV-A</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/Q8y6yqCQEeyLwc-oA1kV-A">https://hyp.is/Q8y6yqCQEeyLwc-oA1kV-A</a> |

I tested out the search bar using common terms such as “good” and “bad” as well as “teaching”, and the graph was quite clearly skewed towards the favor of male teachers, and the female teachers were on the lower spectrum for good terminology, but on the lower side of it for the bad terminology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="https://hyp.is/JULYaJ78EeynFQ8IWvNN3g">https://hyp.is/JULYaJ78EeynFQ8IWvNN3g</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/JULYaJ78EeynFQ8IWvNN3g">https://hyp.is/JULYaJ78EeynFQ8IWvNN3g</a> |

| India Wright          | 02/22/2022 | any of the two billion books in the Goodreads library could become a classic in users' hands.

Are the classics actually great books worthy of decades of study? Or did a white man 50 years ago just decide it was a classic to him? This reminds me of the discussion we had about how the people in power decide what information gets shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | <a href="https://hyp.is/-EAi0pP6Eey2wG_EZL0quA">https://hyp.is/-EAi0pP6Eey2wG_EZL0quA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/-EAi0pP6Eey2wG_EZL0quA">https://hyp.is/-EAi0pP6Eey2wG_EZL0quA</a> |

He says "data is a fact of representation, always. But that's not the kind of fact that people are usually thinking of." And at 48:30: "I think that data are facts, but not of that kind. They're facts of representation." That's a good point, and a great way to answer the question he was asked. It's definitely something to think about. I had to pause to make sure I was processing exactly what he was saying. He mentions how erroneous information is still data, and it can be very useful. I really enjoyed his talk about data and how the word's meaning has changed over the past hundreds of years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | <a href="https://hyp.is/f6O4_H38Eey-SntV7QnSsw">https://hyp.is/f6O4_H38Eey-SntV7QnSsw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/f6O4_H38Eey-SntV7QnSsw">https://hyp.is/f6O4_H38Eey-SntV7QnSsw</a> |

| Cathy Zhang           | 05/03/2022 | We seek to open up a space for exchange between the humanities, arts, and sciences – a space that is genuinely collaborative, that is mutually beneficial, and that recognises that networks present a mode of inquiry that draws on knowledge and practices from all these domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | This shows that science and humanities always complement each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/SDfvdMqpEey7o0fPeNCBGw">https://hyp.is/SDfvdMqpEey7o0fPeNCBGw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/SDfvdMqpEey7o0fPeNCBGw">https://hyp.is/SDfvdMqpEey7o0fPeNCBGw</a> |

| Cathy Zhang           | 05/10/2022 | We’re suggesting that indexing is a more precise replacement for some of the work that travels under the name of “cleaning.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | I strongly support this idea.

I also strongly agree with the author's statement that digital media is a milestone in the new age of media. Data can digitize and visualize abstract information, and if it can be combined with some visual impact, such as pictures and tables, it will allow almost everyone to understand the message that needs to be conveyed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="https://hyp.is/nNqCqoOAEeycLkP9kJawZw">https://hyp.is/nNqCqoOAEeycLkP9kJawZw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/nNqCqoOAEeycLkP9kJawZw">https://hyp.is/nNqCqoOAEeycLkP9kJawZw</a> |
| Cathy Zhang           | 02/15/2022 | These are five of the 30 topics produced by our topic model (based on 120,000+ Goodreads reviews of "classic" texts), which we labeled The Classics Industry. The table displays our hand label for the topic; the most probable words for the topic; the texts that are most probable for the topic (when we aggregate all the reviews for that text); and a sample review that ranked highly for the topic, with top words bolded.

| Cathy Zhang           | 02/08/2022 | This dataset isn’t perfect. As with Mulan, a plot can center around a character, even though the dialogue doesn’t reflect it.

My professor mentioned in CMN 375 (visual media impact) that sometimes the images have more impact than words, and that just because character X has a lot of lines doesn't mean it's a character X-driven movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <a href="https://hyp.is/5Q-4loiVEeyHbAdNxyTWXg">https://hyp.is/5Q-4loiVEeyHbAdNxyTWXg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/5Q-4loiVEeyHbAdNxyTWXg">https://hyp.is/5Q-4loiVEeyHbAdNxyTWXg</a> |

| Cathy Zhang           | 02/08/2022 | For the idea of a sex binary to gain force, it would take figures like Thomas Jefferson declaring that all men were created equal, and entire countries like the United States to be founded on that principle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | It's like what was mentioned in Chapter 1, men, white people, and rich people are the dominant group in society, and the dominant group has more opportunities than others to pursue influential careers.

But I don't understand why, as a social media software, Twitter can be ranked second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | <a href="https://hyp.is/T84vhIUQEeyfBjeVQ1daQA">https://hyp.is/T84vhIUQEeyfBjeVQ1daQA</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/T84vhIUQEeyfBjeVQ1daQA">https://hyp.is/T84vhIUQEeyfBjeVQ1daQA</a> |
| Cathy Zhang           | 02/03/2022 | This man makes a third less than you, and his education ended with a B.S. from a large, perfectly fine state university. But he has 500+ connections on LinkedIn. That plus sign after the “500” bothers you. How many more than 500 people does he know? Five? Five thousand?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | I feel very emotional when I see this, my friends and I are now in the same state as this person who is connecting people like crazy on LinkedIn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="https://hyp.is/zIDDOoUPEeyxdnskaeAFRQ">https://hyp.is/zIDDOoUPEeyxdnskaeAFRQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/zIDDOoUPEeyxdnskaeAFRQ">https://hyp.is/zIDDOoUPEeyxdnskaeAFRQ</a> |
| Cathy Zhang           | 02/01/2022 | This initiative combined a wealth of new documentary sources (via digitization) with existing scholarship and historical maps to provide opportunities to create new interpretations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | I am very supportive of this initiative. This method of digitizing literature and combining it with maps is very friendly to non-specialist readers. Using a visual approach to communicate digitized information to readers can make a deeper impression and make it easier for them to understand what the information is trying to convey to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | <a href="https://hyp.is/iZRxvIMQEeyZ9WsdmMTnVw">https://hyp.is/iZRxvIMQEeyZ9WsdmMTnVw</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/iZRxvIMQEeyZ9WsdmMTnVw">https://hyp.is/iZRxvIMQEeyZ9WsdmMTnVw</a> |

It is not an unnecessary thing to learn to use these tools to practice one's logic and organization skills, instead of having all the files in a mess. I'm still in the habit of using folders and directories, and Notion is a great tool where I create directories and keep my notes and plans in a very clear way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/0FUt3n8GEeyooF-qbZJ-Pg">https://hyp.is/0FUt3n8GEeyooF-qbZJ-Pg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/0FUt3n8GEeyooF-qbZJ-Pg">https://hyp.is/0FUt3n8GEeyooF-qbZJ-Pg</a> |
| Cathy Zhang           | 01/26/2022 | We need database literacies, algorithmic literacies, computational literacies, interface literacies. We need new hybrid practitioners: artist-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars; theoretical archivists, critical race coders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | This reminds me of the team composition model of some network companies. It is usually composed of designers, software engineers and product managers. One of those who needs to be both database literate, algorithm literate, computationally literate, and interface literate is the product manager. This can lead to extremely high competency requirements for the product manager practitioner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <a href="https://hyp.is/_M8AVH8DEey182djTtkrIQ">https://hyp.is/_M8AVH8DEey182djTtkrIQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/_M8AVH8DEey182djTtkrIQ">https://hyp.is/_M8AVH8DEey182djTtkrIQ</a> |
| Cathy Zhang           | 01/25/2022 | because it's easy to think that search tools that worked perfectly well a few years ago won't have been consciously degraded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I think there is a possibility that new tools are constantly being upgraded, companies no longer focus on the previous search engines. As new tools are invented, people then use those tools less often, causing them not to realize the deliberate degrading of tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <a href="https://hyp.is/zkMpAH4DEeySswvVPwy1wQ">https://hyp.is/zkMpAH4DEeySswvVPwy1wQ</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/zkMpAH4DEeySswvVPwy1wQ">https://hyp.is/zkMpAH4DEeySswvVPwy1wQ</a> |

Through the Internet, the library can be accessed by everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | <a href="https://hyp.is/y0YXgn4BEeyMg2-Pwu5vYg">https://hyp.is/y0YXgn4BEeyMg2-Pwu5vYg</a> | <a href="https://hyp.is/y0YXgn4BEeyMg2-Pwu5vYg">https://hyp.is/y0YXgn4BEeyMg2-Pwu5vYg</a> |

| Cathy Zhang           | 01/20/2022 | Our archives are no longer stacks of historical documents for posterity. These archives now contain an understanding of history as a geologic record written by the human hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | I think this is a really good idea to call people not to always rely on the works that have been completed by previous people.
