| Yingyu Chen           | 2022-05-03 | <a href="https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/projects">https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/projects</a>    <a href="https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/projects">https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/projects</a>  While I was browsing on the internet to find interesting DH projects, these two websites -- which both have clusters of digital humanities project caught my eyes. These two websites have project in various field -- geography, network, history, technology ... I saw many topics we had discussed during this semester and also gave me insight on what DH can extend to in today's world. →  <a href="https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/2a59a6fe-3e93-43ae-a42f-1b26d1b4becc">https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/2a59a6fe-3e93-43ae-a42f-1b26d1b4becc</a>   This chapter has a topic that I am really interested in -- disability and universal design. I think it is a great article to learn about universal design and more specifically designing for accessibility. This websites has highlight -- that I do not know if it is intentionally created by the author, but fun to read other's highlighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

In this article, the author discusses Google's plan to have a similar privacy change for Android devices and how it hurts companies that profit from tracking this information such as Meta. →  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/google-plans-android-privacy-change-similar-to-apples.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/google-plans-android-privacy-change-similar-to-apples.html</a>  → As someone who is potentially interested in going into the field of data science, I found this article by a ph.d data scientist who interviewed 30 data scientists about their careers to be an interesting read. In this article he dives into daily tasks, applications in different fields, new skills that need to be learned, and the ethics within data science. →  <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists">https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists</a>  → This data visualization does a great job at reporting an underreported social issue in police violence. The numbers alone are quite startling, but the graphics really show a lot in my opinion. →  <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/</a>  → I found this article to be a fun application of data analytics as the author used past 2k ratings and basketball statistics to create multiple models to predict future NBA2k ratings as well as to tell whether players were over or underrated. →  <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/sport-analytics-nba-2k-ratings-prediction-b7b72e2e72eb">https://towardsdatascience.com/sport-analytics-nba-2k-ratings-prediction-b7b72e2e72eb</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                  | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

A lot of what is posted on here is very relevant to current events and news (i.e. the Roe v. Wade post) and shows off really interesting techniques, styles, and design practices that people might want to try out for their final projects. Hope this helps and/or provides people with some entertainment! →  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/30/why-your-kids-will-want-to-be-data-scientists.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/30/why-your-kids-will-want-to-be-data-scientists.html</a>  Interesting article I found a little while ago about the future of data science, as people saw it in 2014. Pretty spot on prediction as I'm sure a lot of you want to be data scientists, and lot of the points in this article I have heard brought up in my professional/careers IS classes. There's a lot of money in this field and its growing as big data becomes more and more profitable →  <a href="https://figuresinthesky.visualcinnamon.com/">https://figuresinthesky.visualcinnamon.com/</a>   Finally I'd like to share this extremely cool article about how constellations and stars have been viewed by different cultures and societies. They use lots of different visualization techniques, including a graph of star brightness with how many constellations it is used in. There are several interactive parallax modules you can use to view all the constellations in the night sky. Pretty fascinating stuff.

I thoughts it's interesting because they are treating old generation video game as a piece of history. They want to digitize the game copy, save it on the internet, and show it to everyone like an exhibit. Unlike an item in a museum, the digitized copy will also be available to everyone.

| Jerry Xu              | 2022-04-18 | I'd like to share this article. The author incorporates data visualization and finds out that the homeless problem isn't exactly solved with homeless population decreases. They simply just relocates to other city. To think that data visualization is really powerful that it usually show problems and insights that we normally wouldn't see or notice.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study</a>  → Also like to share this person who I followed.

| Jacky Chen            | 2022-05-01 | I would like to share this article centering on techniques in NER (named equality recognition). The NER technology allows the parsing of a massive amount of data in a short time for supporting historical hypotheses. For this article, the authors looked into how NER models can help parse the Medieval Latin Charters.  One thing I found interesting was that the research team used two ways to increase the accuracy of this model. The first one is machine learning technology that by splitting the corpus into training and testing parts. The second technique is cross-validation so the results can be validated using similar contexts from different sources.   <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000574/000574.html">http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000574/000574.html</a>  → Another article that I would like to share is about how data science reveals "How we communicate, what we value – even who we are". ( <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-we-communicate-what-we-value-even-who-we-are-8-surprising-things-data-science-has-revealed-about-us-over-the-past-decade-176891)">https://theconversation.com/how-we-communicate-what-we-value-even-who-we-are-8-surprising-things-data-science-has-revealed-about-us-over-the-past-decade-176891)</a>  There are two findings in this article I found interesting. What's more, using what we learned from class, I can start to understand which methods the researchers used to discover their findings.  The first finding is that: **Cultural turnover is accelerating**, which means that we are forgetting the past faster. I recalled that we used Google ngram viewer in the class to explore patterns of the frequency of how words change over time. The second finding is that: **Human language diversity and biodiversity are correlated**. This is a finding that I have never thought about, but I think it shows that it is worthwhile to do some EDA and connect the data, manipulate and analyze it to draw some useful conclusions from it. | <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933527303693139991/970417891147149432/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933527303693139991/970417891147149432/unknown.png</a>                                                                                             |
| Jacky Chen            | 2022-04-23 | I would like to share some resources related to data visualization. I completed a certificate in "Tableau desktop Specialist". Tableau is a data viz tool developed by Salesforce and it is widely used by many companies. For example, some data analytics job asks the candidates to be familiar with Tableau or PowerBI. Listed resources -- Most of them are free! I got the certificate without spending a cent prep-ing for it. 0.

From her blog, I learned that she did not know anything about web dev before she started this project. It is inspiring and interesting to see people can pick up coding really fast if practicing daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Faadil Ahmed          | 2022-05-11 | I found this article very interesting because you break down the definition of digital humanities, the subject of artificial intelligence creating poetry is weird as to how it fits in. Humans not being able to tell the difference between human written and ai generated poetry, comes to show how far we have advanced, it may not be the best thing, as it takes away from the art.  <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/ai-poetry/">https://thewalrus.ca/ai-poetry/</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The code was a little hard to follow with the amount of tools and processes used to manipulate the data to find the results, but it was very intricate to see how they were performed, as well ass the results.  <a href="https://medium.com/@jleuschen17/nba-datavisualuzation-in-python-1b6b75e301d4">https://medium.com/@jleuschen17/nba-datavisualuzation-in-python-1b6b75e301d4</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Cathy Zhang           | 2022-04-28 | I would like to share some websites and projects about data visualization.  The first one is  <a href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/.">https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/.</a>  The author explains data visualization in depth based on telling stories. And also sets monthly data visualization challenges for the site users and gives help and reviews. I think we can try to participate in this challenge to practice our skills → The second one is  <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/.">https://informationisbeautiful.net/.</a>  The author uses a bright minimalist design style to showcase many custom projects in his blog. For him, sometimes some very fragmented daily topics or even gimmicky news are great sources to showcase data visualization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Cathy Zhang           | 2022-04-10 | This is an extended article about the April 5 reading because we know that machine learning will still have a lot of bias. this article is about how some people can use these algorithmic flaws to their advantage. As well as the fact that sometimes we see bias that may have been intentionally recommended to you by the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933527303693139991/962857026487222303/How_YouTube_Radicalized_Brazil_-_The_New_York_Times_2.pdf">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933527303693139991/962857026487222303/How_YouTube_Radicalized_Brazil_-_The_New_York_Times_2.pdf</a> |

| Caroline Stoklosinski | 2022-05-17 | This article is similar to our discussions on NLP and how they can be used for things like books, movies, etc. In this case the topic of interest was on the TV series "Murder, She Wrote" from 1984-86.

| Braden Monahan        | 2022-05-12 | This is an interesting article discussing the use of deep learning language models to analyze the sentiments in translations of the sacred Hindi text Bhagavad Gita. The learning model was run on 3 different English translations of a poem within the text to see if the translations were able to maintain the sentiment even though they all used different vocabulary. It was found that they did all show similar sentiments of optimism, annoyance, and surprise.  <a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-philosophy-and-religion-what-machine-learning-can-tell-us-about-the-bhagavad-gita-182517">https://theconversation.com/ai-philosophy-and-religion-what-machine-learning-can-tell-us-about-the-bhagavad-gita-182517</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Braden Monahan        | 2022-05-11 | This article discusses a new practice to advance digital humanities at MIT. MIT libraries are hosting a weekly meeting where people can discuss all things digital humanities. This is bringing together people from different fields with different research interests to talk with DH experts. I think this is a great idea and shows the increasing popularity and importance of DH. They also record all of these meetings and upload them to their YouTube channel ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRvYzZqiaI_OPzvlKjbubp6BlLE-lZF70)">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRvYzZqiaI_OPzvlKjbubp6BlLE-lZF70)</a>  so they can be watched back by participants or anyone.  <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/online-hub-research-teaching-brings-digital-humanities-to-the-fore-0622">https://news.mit.edu/2021/online-hub-research-teaching-brings-digital-humanities-to-the-fore-0622</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Braden Monahan        | 2022-03-09 | <a href="https://www.sechicagohistory.org/archive/">https://www.sechicagohistory.org/archive/</a>  This is a database that holds a collection of photos, artifacts, and recordings relevant to the deindustrialization of Chicago in the 20th century. I found it after reading this article  <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/walley-boebel-working-class-chicago-0922">https://news.mit.edu/2021/walley-boebel-working-class-chicago-0922</a>  that asked some questions of the cretors of the database.

| Antonio Sanchez       | 2022-05-15 | This article is quite interesting as it discusses how machine learning is being used in soccer transfers. Oftentimes, key indicators for selling and buying soccer players was based on goals and assists. But as the article mentioned, machine learning has made it possible to determine if a player would pivotal a team based on all other factors.   <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/using-machine-learning-to-identify-high-value-football-transfer-targets-d4151a7ffcac">https://towardsdatascience.com/using-machine-learning-to-identify-high-value-football-transfer-targets-d4151a7ffcac</a>  → You’ll have to create an account to access the data. The data itself deals with statistics involving women such as rights, violations and it is the most comprehensive compilation of information on the status of women in the world. It is a great resource to research gender related issues  <a href="https://www.womanstats.org/new/view/">https://www.womanstats.org/new/view/</a>  → This is a fun example of data visualizations.

It runs many different types of analysis, for example discovering if there is a correlation with move duration (how long an attack takes) and damage of move, and another analysis between how fast a character is and how much damage they do on average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
