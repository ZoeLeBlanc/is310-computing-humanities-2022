&lt;p&gt;I wanted to reflect on our 3/22 seminar discussion and readings. My first reaction to &lt;em&gt;Data Humanism, The Revolution will be Visualized.&lt;/em&gt; was surprise. I had never heard anyone say infographics should be complicated before. I did understand the author’s point that by simplifying information to make easy-to-understand infographics, important information and nuance could be lost. Additionally, oversimplified infographics can be even more confusing than detailed infographics due to missing context or details that aid a viewer’s understanding. The examples from the reading were really cool and interesting to analyze. However, in our class discussion, one of my classmates said that both types of infographics have a role to play. After that, I realized that we should be expanding on what infographics can be, and not just changing what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reading tied into the &lt;em&gt;Isn’t it obvious?&lt;/em&gt; reading and the &lt;em&gt;Confabulation in the humanities&lt;/em&gt; reading. Lincoln Mullen mentioned that visualizations should not be able to immediately be used to explain things we already know. After seeing what Matthew Lincoln did to “trick” the audience in his article, this is especially evident. Visualized data has its own complexity outside of existing data. After taking in these two reading and discussing them in class, I came to understand that we should not think of data visualizations as only a supporting tool for other research. It can, and according to these authors, should stand alone. I think that point helps argue how important data visualization and digital research in the humanities is since it adds its own points that can be separate from other, more traditionally humanistic data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dharra Prashad</name></author><category term="curating-course-content" /><summary type="html">March 22nd Blogpost I wanted to reflect on our 3/22 seminar discussion and readings.

I first watched the interview with Amber Thomas about &lt;em&gt;shaping ideas into data stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Awc4HxDK0&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Awc4HxDK0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video talks about three things. The first came was how Amber shifted from a journalist to a journalist engineer. The change in the title made me think. How different can it be because she is still writing stories? So she explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I collect and analyze data and do front-end web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how she explains the definition of being an engineer. Sure, it is exactly what engineers would do to realize the technology to a finished product. But why not separate the two and have the best journalist and the best front-end engineer work together? It means to specialize in one thing, not both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know the answer, so I went to the Puddings and read some of their posts. Those were easy to read, and very interesting articles. So I began to understand how does being a journalist engineer would be like. By learning how to code, the journlist can do so much more in their job with the power of computing. They can also better deliver their result by front end development and data visualization. However, everything is rooted on the acumen of the everyday life and society and the creativity. So, the core of being a journalist would not go away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jacky Chen</name></author><category term="curating-course-content" /><summary type="html">It was the first week of the class, and one of the first readings assigned was in the Puddings.
