Faadil Ahmed,2022-05-11,None,"I found this article very interesting because you break down the definition of digital humanities, the subject of artificial intelligence creating poetry is weird as to how it fits in. Humans not being able to tell the difference between human written and ai generated poetry, comes to show how far we have advanced, it may not be the best thing, as it takes away from the art. https://thewalrus.ca/ai-poetry/"
Faadil Ahmed,2022-05-03,None,"I thought this source was very interesting, because it expands on the concepts of data cleaning, filtering, and visualization. The code was a little hard to follow with the amount of tools and processes used to manipulate the data to find the results, but it was very intricate to see how they were performed, as well ass the results. https://medium.com/@jleuschen17/nba-datavisualuzation-in-python-1b6b75e301d4"
Faadil Ahmed,2022-04-25,None,I would like to share this resource because it gives an really interesting way and different types of methods to convey ur data through data filtering and data visualizations. The website shows many examples of how to use pandas and numpy to create what you want to share. https://towardsdatascience.com/fifa-20-player-clustering-f500cf0792c5

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933527303693139991/970417891147149432/unknown.png","Another article that I would like to share is about how data science reveals ""How we communicate, what we value – even who we are"". (https://theconversation.com/how-we-communicate-what-we-value-even-who-we-are-8-surprising-things-data-science-has-revealed-about-us-over-the-past-decade-176891) There are two findings in this article I found interesting. What's more, using what we learned from class, I can start to understand which methods the researchers used to discover their findings.

The first finding is that: **Cultural turnover is accelerating**, which means that we are forgetting the past faster. I recalled that we used Google ngram viewer in the class to explore patterns of the frequency of how words change over time.
The second finding is that: **Human language diversity and biodiversity are correlated**. This is a finding that I have never thought about, but I think it shows that it is worthwhile to do some EDA and connect the data, manipulate and analyze it to draw some useful conclusions from it.,I would like to share this article centering on techniques in NER (named equality recognition). The NER technology allows the parsing of a massive amount of data in a short time for supporting historical hypotheses. For this article, the authors looked into how NER models can help parse the Medieval Latin Charters.

One thing I found interesting was that the research team used two ways to increase the accuracy of this model. The first one is machine learning technology that by splitting the corpus into training and testing parts. The second technique is cross-validation so the results can be validated using similar contexts from different sources.

Finally I'd like to share this extremely cool article about how constellations and stars have been viewed by different cultures and societies. They use lots of different visualization techniques, including a graph of star brightness with how many constellations it is used in. There are several interactive parallax modules you can use to view all the constellations in the night sky. Pretty fascinating stuff. 

(note: I found this because of one of Professor Leblanc's earlier messages recommending an author for a book I think? Don't exactly remember),https://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/30/why-your-kids-will-want-to-be-data-scientists.html
Interesting article I found a little while ago about the future of data science, as people saw it in 2014. Pretty spot on prediction as I'm sure a lot of you want to be data scientists, and lot of the points in this article I have heard brought up in my professional/careers IS classes. There's a lot of money in this field and its growing as big data becomes more and more profitable,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/
This is actually not an article but a community page on reddit (a subreddit) that is all about data and showcasing users' data visualizations. A lot of what is posted on here is very relevant to current events and news (i.e. the Roe v. Wade post) and shows off really interesting techniques, styles, and design practices that people might want to try out for their final projects. Hope this helps and/or provides people with some entertainment!"
