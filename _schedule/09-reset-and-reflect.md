## Class Activities

*This session differs from the original syllabus so that we can focus on catching up on some of the coding concepts for the final project. Readings will be moved to subsequent weeks.*

Prior to class, please complete [Introduction to Python]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/intro-python-git/02-beginning-python) if you haven't already, and start on [Python Fundamentals]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/04-python-fundamentals). Our goal for this class session is to to complete the full `Introduction to Python and Git` and get started with [Advanced Python]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/advanced-python/01-more-python).

## Ready To Go Faster?

1. Complete and push up the [Intro to Python Assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/intro-python-git/06-python-assignment). If you have issues with Github or git, checkout the [Github Workflows page]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/intro-python-git/07-github-workflows).
2. Complete and push up the first [Advanced Python Assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/advanced-python/02-python-assignment).
3. If you have completed all of that, then make sure you read through [Advanced Python: Part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/advanced-python/03-complex-python) and the instructions for setting up a virtual environment and then you can complete the [Python libraries assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/materials/advanced-python/05-libraries-assignment).
