For the "Deep-Fried Data" reading, I recommend to read  "What's Up With Big Data Ethics?" The article is about data ethics from Big Data. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2014/03/28/whats-up-with-big-data-ethics/?sh=497dcd853591>

Probably many of you have already seen this TED video, about filter bubbles by Eli Pariser. This video might be related with our first reading, "WHY AN AGE OF MACHINE LEARNING NEEDS THE HUMANITIES" <https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles>
