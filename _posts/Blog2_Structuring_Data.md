# Structuring Data
jacky

In this blog post I would like to reflect how do humanists structure and process data. 

The article, **Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction,** discusses, in the end, the two different view on an issue between the librarian/data scientists and a humanitarian. Humanists understand issues in a qualitative, critical view and justify the issue by how we see the world. Data scientists would find data, nuances and patterns and use quantitative tools to justify that how and why things happened. In some shapes of form, the two world view can be hard to merge. But just like the author mentioned:

> “I think that’s why digital humanities is so challenging and fun, because you’re always holding in your head this tension between the power of computation and the inadequacy of data to truly represent reality.”
> 

The article, ****Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data**** talks about a perspective to understand data that looking at how, where and why the data is created. 

> *Where did it come from? Who collected it? How was it collected? Most importantly, why was it collected?*
> 

It gives me a new perspective in how we should read our data. The data itself has story, and this is as importatnt as drawing patterns and conclusions from the data.
