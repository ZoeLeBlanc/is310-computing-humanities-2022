# The history of Web — Geocity
jacky

This article is my favorite one for this semester! I like the idea of Geocity. Although it is gone already, I am still inspired by the concept of connecting everyone as a web community. It made me think about the concept of "metaverse" that is trending recently. Whether is 1990s or 2020s, we are all doing the same thing -- computing in humanities. That is what made the idea shine and popular. It cannot be the technologies alone. 

When looking at the history, we can find how the world has changed. In the 90s, the user of Geocity are only given 1 megabyte of storage for their blogs. One Megabyte... without pictures and videos. It is a decent amount for a CSS and HTML based website. That means only Text. It is also very interesting to see how people who use that amount to storage to decorate their personal blog.

It is the most touching part for me. 

When I was reading this part, I think it is a huge thing. If the data is deleted, then it is GONE. At that time, storing the scale of all data from GeoCities would not be crazely expensive -- but definately not cheap.

From this example I can see how the librairan and archivists have a mind or perhaps ... obessesion in curating data. It is almost why they are here from the old data (like the burned, banned books examples to now in the Internet era). The curating technologies and ways may shift, but hey, all they are doing is one simple thing -- to keep data alive.

Here is a excerpt I found online from the archivist that saved data from GeoCIties:

> "There’s a chance that in the 1990s, you were more familiar with neighborhoods on GeoCities than with the neighborhoods in your own town. As one of the most popular and oldest (nearly 15 years running) sites for self expression on the web, GeoCities paved the way for other sites which would offer a sense of community and networking capabilities. Because it was one of the first ways for people to freely and openly become engaged with the internet, GeoCities will always be an important part of web history.

> Yahoo! announced that it will close the site on October 26, 2009, steering users towards their paid service instead. We have been archiving GeoCities sites for years in our crawls, but, as goes with the territory of being web archivists, we want to make sure to gather as many of the pages as possible before the looming end of an era, 10-26-2009. If you have a page with GeoCities or are a fan of a particular page, please use our special collections page to ensure its preservation. Additionally, please refer to another independent project, the Archive Team, who is working to save cultural information that may be lost with the site closing. Yahoo! is also offering valuable advice at their help center. –Cara Binder

The author also talked about that “the geographical community metaphor meshed well with a public that was conditioned to think of GeoCities, the renamed Beverly Hills Internet, as an ever- expanding geographical space”.

When I read what was GeoCities, I was a little bit confused of what aspect made it unique: here I found a more detailed expanation on Wiki, and I think it offers a better edge to understand this concept brought by Bohnett:

"In its original form, site users selected a "city" in which to list the hyperlinks to their web pages. The "cities" were named after real cities or regions according to their content – for example, computer-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to "Hollywood"; hence the name of the site. Soon after its acquisition by Yahoo!, this practice was abandoned in favour of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs."
