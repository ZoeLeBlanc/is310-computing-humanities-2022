In this course, we have two main categories of assessments: weekly ones and ones associated with the semester long project. Both types are less about evaluating you, and more about introducing you to new materials and scaffolding the synthesis of this content with opportunities to engage in research that is meaningful to you. Hopefully you have enrolled in this course because something about computing in the humanities intrinsically interests you and are committed to growing intellectually and methodologically over the course of this semester.
