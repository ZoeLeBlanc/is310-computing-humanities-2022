## Goals

While this course is not a writing course per se, we do read a lot of different written materials (book chapters, articles, blog posts, etc...) and we do want a chance to reflect and synthesize our reading experience beyond seminar discussions. So to that end, we have an assignment where you can curate one of our seminar meeting's as a blog post.

This post can be as long as you want it to be, and must be at least two paragraphs. In your post, rather than trying to summarize our full meeting, you should instead focus on curating and reflecting on your experiences with the materials. For example, if you were blogging in our week about humanities data, you might reflect on how the readings and discussions helped you understand what makes this type of data different from others, and quote some of your peers' annotations to help contextualize your thoughts. You might also include outside materials that you feel are relevant to that week.

## Format

The posts will be written in Markdown and you can send them to the instructor on Discord, who will upload them to the course website on Github.

If you are new to writing in Markdown, than be sure to check out the [Markdown resources page]({{site.baseurl}}//materials/advanced-python/04-markdown-resources) to get started.

You should generally be using headings (so `#`) to organize your post, and then for links you should be using the `[text](url)` format. Finally for images, you should be using the `![alt text](url)` format and including your images in a folder that you also send to the instructor.

Ideally the format of the folder would be:

```sh
blogpost_LASTNAME/
  - images/
    - image1.png
    - image2.png
  - post-title.md
```

*Have any additional questions? Either ask them in our Discord or message the instructor*
